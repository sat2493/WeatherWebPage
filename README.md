### Google API

This webpage makes use of Google Cloud's API features. By accessing the Google Translate API, we were able to pull our translations from the cloud and add them into our project. The API key would be used in our server queries which the English user's english word would trigger a translation query. This API key would then be used by the server to access Google Cloud's Google Translate services.

### Setting up the database

A beta database was used in this project. To set up the database, a node program was used. The sqlite3 module was utilized to set up the database and modify it based on added Flashcards.

Flashcards generated by the user would be saved onto this single database that contained all the flashcards generated by all users. The database itself contained one table, with a row containing a unique ID for the user, the English version of a word, the Korean version of a word, the number of times the card had been called by the user, and the number of times the user guessed the Korean translation directly upon calling the Flashcard.

### Front end with React

React formed the entire UI of this webpage. Using React, entering English text and hitting return on the card creation page would trigger the webpage to change according to each translation. Pressing saves the card onto the database. Pressing 'start review' moves the flashcard onto 'review view'. All this would be done on one HTML page by re-drawing the current page with a state.
