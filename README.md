# Introduction

![Lango1](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~amenta/s19/lango1.png)

This webpage was designed with the enthusiasm and awareness of Google Cloud services along with React's web design capabilities. The end goal of this project was to produce an application that an English user can use to learn Korean. The concept is one that Quizlet uses: create digital flashcards that could be recalled, that tests for either guessing a term correctly or incorrectly. 

# Features

Put together, the following image displays the general action flowchart for the webpage.

In words, there are two types of users: first time, and non-first-time. The application responds differently to these two kinds of users. A first-time user would be greeted by the title website, whereas a non-first-time would skip straight to the main screen. 

Next, clicking the login button would guide them through an authorization process. Upon passing this security layer, the user would then begin accessing the Flashcard features of the website. A user can create as many flashcards as they please. (Note: this project assumes a small user base, so storage capabilities are not a consideration for this stage. This will be addressed under [Limitations and Possible Improvements](https://github.com/sat2493/WeatherWebPage#limitations-and-possible-improvements)

After creating Flashcards, the user could switch onto 'Review Mode' which randomly presents Flashcards to the user. The user has the opportunity to either guess a flashcard correctly or incorrectly. The user has the choice to finish reviewing at their leisure, hence they can switch back to 'Create Mode' to continue creating more flashcards.

# Tools

## Google Cloud Services

Setting up a new, non-business, Google Cloud account allots new users with 100 credits. These credits allow access to many Google services that allow novice application development to be made much easier. Guidance on what cloud storage is and a great resource to start one's own account can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/). For the purposes of this project, Google Cloud's translation and security services provided the user login experience and server security layers. This project required setting up an online project inside the Google Console.

### Google Authorization

Once a cloud account and project has been set up in the Google Console, a security layer can be added onto it. For the purposes of this project, Google's OAuth2 provided the login integrity attached to the web application.

### Google API

This webpage makes use of Google Cloud's API features. By accessing the Google Translate API, translations could be pulled from the cloud and added into our project. The API key would be embedded in all translation queries. This API key would then be used by the server to access Google Cloud's Google Translate services.

### Setting up the database

A beta database was used in this project. To set up the database, a node program was used. The sqlite3 module was utilized to set up the database and modify it based on added Flashcards.

Flashcards generated by the user would be saved onto this single database that contained all the flashcards generated by all users. The database itself contained one table, with a row containing a unique ID for the user, the English version of a word, the Korean version of a word, the number of times the card had been called by the user, and the number of times the user guessed the Korean translation directly upon calling the Flashcard.

### Front end with React

React formed the entire UI of this webpage. Using React, entering English text and hitting return on the card creation page would trigger the webpage to change according to each translation. Pressing saves the card onto the database. Pressing 'start review' moves the flashcard onto 'review view'. All this would be done on one HTML page by re-drawing the current page with a state.

# Limitations and Possible Improvements

One limitation of this project was the use of the sqlite3 module for database. One clear advantage was that it was lightweight and provided an easy set-up, and, for the purpose of this non-scaled application, that was all that was needed. However, offshoring database operations to Firebase would play in favor of increasing scalability, and to quickly remove concerns for developing database operations from scratch. Using Firebase would be a potential improvement that can be added onto this project.
